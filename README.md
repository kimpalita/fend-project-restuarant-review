#### Udacity Front-End Project: Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, we were tasked with converting a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The project requirements are grouped in 3 [rubic](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view) criteria:

1. Converting a statics design to a responsive design.
2. Adding accessibility features so that it is screenreader-friendly.
3. Add a service worker to make the app available offline.

## Getting it up and running
1. Download or clone this git repository.
2. Navigate to this folder, start up a simple HTTP server.
    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
    * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
